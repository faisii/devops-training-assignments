Q2) Explain Docker Containers vs VMs?
  
  The concept of a virtual machine is simple, really: it’s a virtual server that emulates a hardware server. A virtual machine relies on the system’s physical hardware to emulate the exact same environment on which you install your applications. Depending on your use case, you can use a system virtual machine (that runs an entire OS as a process, allowing you to substitute a real machine for a virtual machine), or process virtual machines that let you execute computer applications alone in the virtual environment.
  Containers sit on top of a physical server and its host OS—typically Linux or Windows. Each container shares the host OS kernel and, usually, the binaries and libraries, too. (See below for definitions if you’re not familiar with these terms.) Shared components are read-only.
